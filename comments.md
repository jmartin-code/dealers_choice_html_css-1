## Great work!

Comments:
- Try cleaning up the css file a little by removing empty lines;
- Also, I noticed the "a" tag selector is repeated in your css file. Try consolidating the "a" selector into on;
- Great work with the app.js file, simple and sweet.
- Add a .gitignore file to prevent your .DS_store file from being uploaded to github.


Keep up the good work!
